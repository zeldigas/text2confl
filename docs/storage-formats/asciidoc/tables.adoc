AsciiDoc tables converted to Confluence tables.

== Simple tables

Simple tables are the one that contains just one line of text in every cell:

This text:

----
include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=simple-table]
----

Will produce:

include::_assets/example.adoc[tag=simple-table]

== Complex tables

More complex tables supported too.

Features supported:

. link:{adocs}/tables/add-title/[Table title] (only for Confluence Server or first version of editor in Confluence Cloud)
. link:{adocs}/tables/format-column-content/[Content formatting by column]
. link:{adocs}/tables/format-cell-content/[Cell content formatting]
